		<h1>Reading Response A</h1>
		<u>What is Code?</u> by Paul Ford, 2015.
		<hr>
		<blockquote>In some mysterious way, he outranks you. Not within the company, not in restaurant reservations, not around lawyers. Still: He strokes his short beard; his hands are tanned; he hikes; his socks are embroidered with little ninja.<br><br>
		“Don’t forget,” he says, “we’ve got to budget for apps.”<br><br>
		This is real. A Scrum Master in ninja socks has come into your office and said, “We’ve got to budget for apps.” Should it all go pear-shaped, his career will be just fine.</blockquote>

		<p>I think this quote is a good summary of the theme of the article'ss introduction which really captivated me. Coding in many ways has been the path to success that is entirely merit-based, not needing a degree or even a big book nowadays, just the capacity to use the internet to learn. In that sense it was a positive addition to the diversity of careers available at the time when I was in middle school. Now, it is just a piece of all careers, like writing and reading.</p>
		<p>I think alot about the lack of humility often associated with those in the career. My first experience at a hackathon my sophomore year at college was really unsettling; it has become a running joke to make fun of those less experienced with coding who post jobs on the computer science jobs list, even when they have clearly done their research to the best of their ability. The culture of coding turned me off from majoring in computer science before my professors convinced me otherwise. How many have been affected by this culture?</p>
